# Rust
Practicing with the Rust Language

Just some practice with Rust lol. In case you have a reading deficiency where you can't read titles or line 2 of any page. 
Shit, what if you can't read anything on lines that are evenly divisible by 2?
Well, I guess you'll just have to die lmao
Nothing to see there
